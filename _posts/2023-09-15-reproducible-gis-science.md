**To what extent does open source GIS help solve the problems of the reproducibility crisis for geography? How?**
1. ensures data is available for reproducibility, which both
     * reduces the prevalence of false results (bc people would find them)
     * improves the efficiency of science, reducing needless replication work and making it easier for researchers to
       build on the work of their peers.
     * reduces the toxic pressure to publish (?)
**Are there problems with reproducibility and replicability in geography that open source GIS cannot help solve?**
