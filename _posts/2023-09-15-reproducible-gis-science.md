**To what extent does open source GIS help solve the problems of the reproducibility crisis for geography? How?**
1. ensures data is available for reproducibility, which both
     * reduces the prevalence of false results (bc people would find them)
     * improves the efficiency of science, reducing needless replication work and making it easier for researchers to
       build on the work of their peers.
     * reduces the toxic pressure to publish (?)
       
**Are there problems with reproducibility and replicability in geography that open source GIS cannot help solve?**
2. Documentation. One criticism of open source communities is that they lack strong documentation. Documentation is critical to reproducibility and replicability because one needs to know exactly what they are doing in order to reproduce or modify a study


The development of GIS software in an open source environment and the practice of using GIS to conduct open source science both have the potential to address the reproducibility crisis in geography.
Open source software *development* ensures that researchers can use the same software used in a particular study without having to pay for proprietary software or be in a certain physical location to use it. (J. S. Rey, 2009). 
This makes conducting reproduction studies, where the exact data and methods used by the original study are used in the new study, easier and more accessible.
