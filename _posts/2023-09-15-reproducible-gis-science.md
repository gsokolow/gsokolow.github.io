**To what extent does open source GIS help solve the problems of the reproducibility crisis for geography? How?**
1. ensures data is available for reproducibility, which both
     * reduces the prevalence of false results (bc people would find them)
     * improves the efficiency of science, reducing needless replication work and making it easier for researchers to
       build on the work of their peers.
     * reduces the toxic pressure to publish (?)
       
**Are there problems with reproducibility and replicability in geography that open source GIS cannot help solve?**
2. Documentation. One criticism of open source communities is that they lack strong documentation. Documentation is critical to reproducibility and replicability because one needs to know exactly what they are doing in order to reproduce or modify a study


The development of GIS software in an open source environment and the practice of using GIS to conduct open source science both have the potential to address the reproducibility crisis in geography.
Open source software *development* ensures that researchers can use the same software used in a particular study without having to pay for proprietary software or be in a certain physical location to use it. (J. S. Rey, 2009). 
This makes conducting reproduction studies, where the exact data and methods used by the original study are used in the new study, easier and more accessible.
Reproduction studies also benefit from the *use* of open source GIS in source studies. The principles of open source science dictate that the exact data and code used in a study be publicly available. 
Thus, when researchers *do* open science in addition to *using* open source software, they make sure that the inputs used in their studies, and not just the tools they used, are available to the public for verification and reproduction.
Furthermore, when researchers conduct their studies using the principles of open science, they pave the way for future researchers to corroborate, challenge, and refine their conclusions through replication studies, in which the question of the original story is asked in a new context or altered slightly in the original context. 
It's important for researchers attempting to replicate a study to have access to the original data and source code so that they can focus on improving or adopting the study, rather than reconstructing it.
Even beyond making replication studies more efficient, open-source science makes it possible for researchers to learn from eachother's tools, strategies, and disciplines to ask new questions, or perhaps address old ones in new ways. 

In addition to making research more rigorous, open-source GIS has the potential to contribute to positive cultural change in the research community. Part of the crisis of reproducibility within geography stems from the immense publishing pressure imposed on researchers by their academic institutions. 
Their career advancement is not determined by the quality of their work, nor the depth of their contributions to the scientific community, but by the number of papers they publish and the flashy conclusions they draw. 
This creates an incentive for some researchers to falsify or contourt their conclusions to improve their chance of publication (Ainsworth, 2019). 
By encouraging transparency in data and code, an open-science framework would make it very difficult to publish fake or altered results.

that encourages collaboration would  through an open-science framework, Open-source GIS


Open source-GIS thus has much to offer the geography research community in generating a body of knowledge that is publicly accessible, rigorously developed, and growing efficiently as well as an environment in which collaboration
