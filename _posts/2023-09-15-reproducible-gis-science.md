**To what extent does open source GIS help solve the problems of the reproducibility crisis for geography? How?**
1. ensures data is available for reproducibility, which both
     * reduces the prevalence of false results (bc people would find them)
     * improves the efficiency of science, reducing needless replication work and making it easier for researchers to
       build on the work of their peers.
     * reduces the toxic pressure to publish (?)
       
**Are there problems with reproducibility and replicability in geography that open source GIS cannot help solve?**
2. Documentation. One criticism of open source communities is that they lack strong documentation. Documentation is critical to reproducibility and replicability because one needs to know exactly what they are doing in order to reproduce or modify a study


The development of GIS software in an open source environment and the practice of using GIS to conduct open source science both have the potential to address the reproducibility crisis in geography.
Open source software *development* ensures that researchers can use the same software used in a particular study without having to pay for proprietary software or be in a certain physical location to use it. (J. S. Rey, 2009). 
This makes conducting reproduction studies, where the exact data and methods used by the original study are used in the new study, easier and more accessible.
Reproduction studies also benefit from the *use* of open source GIS in source studies. The principles of open source science dictate that the exact data and code used in a study be publicly available. 
Thus, when researchers *do* open science in addition to *using* open source software, they make sure that the inputs used in their studies, and not just the tools they used, are available to the public for verification and reproduction.
Furthermore, when researchers conduct their studies using the principles of open science, they pave the way for future researchers to corroborate, challenge, and refine their conclusions through replication studies, in which the question of the original story is asked in a new context or altered slightly in the original context in an effort to test the generalizability of the original findings.
