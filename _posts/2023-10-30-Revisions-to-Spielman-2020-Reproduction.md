In 2003, [Cutter et. al](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6237.8402002) published a social vulnerability index for the United States at the county level. In 2020, [Spielman et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11069-019-03820-z) successfully reproduced Cutter's index and developed new methods to test the internal consistency and construct validity of the index by recalculating it at different spatial scales: nationally, by FEMA region, and for a sample state within each region. In 2023, [Joe Holler et al.](https://gsokolow.github.io/RPl-Spielman-2020/) conducted a successful reproduction study of Spielman's internal consistency analysis. Holler's team also visualized the original social vulnerability index scores (SoVIs) on a national scale. They also tested an alternate method for calculating SoVI scores using the variance explained in the principal component analysis (PCA) as a weight for the component variables. While the differences observed between the two sets of scores is minor, further investigation into each method's accuracy may be warranted.
