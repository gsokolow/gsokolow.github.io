I am particularly interested in your interpretation and reaction to figure 6.1 in Longley et al (2008) with regards to the three questions/prompts below:

Do you have first-hand knowledge or experience with uncertainty in spatial/geographic research?
What responsibilities do geographers have with regards to uncertainty in research?
What strategies might geographers use to fulfill those responsibilities?

As children, we may be taught that maps tell truths. As geographers, we are taught that maps lie.
Just like any other model, maps simplify the world around us so that we may better understand it.
Any choice we make to simplify necessarily creates the opportunity for bias and uncertainty.
In Chapter 6 of **Geographic information systems and science** (Langley et al, 2008), the following figure is presented as a 'conceptual view of uncertainty.
The three filters, U1, U2, and U3 can distort the way in which the complexity of the real world is conceived, measured, represented, and analyzed in a cumulative way.'

This figure represents how uncertainty can manifest at every stage of abstraction/analysis... but fails to adequately show how it can magnify?
