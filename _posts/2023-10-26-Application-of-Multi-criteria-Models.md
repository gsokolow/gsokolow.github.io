Do you have interests in other applications of multi-criteria models? If so, have you learned any important lessons from our reproductions and readings about vulnerability models which can be applied to other applications?

Multicriteria models are interesting to me because they intuitively feel as though they have more explanatory power than single critereon models. When models built on one or two variables make the caveat that, of course, they cannot explain all the variation in outcome because there are so many factors at play in the universe, multicriteria models appear to be a magical solution. They can account for lots of potential varibles - but just like their simpler single critereon cousins, multicriteria models are not in fact, omnipotent.

One of the most important questions to ask any model, but especially multicriteria models, is: *How closely do the results of my model align with reality?* We can throw variables at the computer all day long, but unless they can successfully model the subject at hand, even the most mathematically sophisticated model won't be worth all that much. But the eternal question remains: How do you test the accuracy of a novel metric? If you could already quantify reality, chances are, you probably wouldn't be trying to model it (unless you are doing a replication study!!).
